Excellent — you’re thinking strategically. Designing strong, data-driven **Financial Mathematics** projects that use **publicly available datasets** will give you a great foundation for both your **Master’s thesis** and future Ph.D. research.

Below are **3 well-scoped project ideas** — each includes:

- **Core concept** (the research goal)
- **Public datasets** you can use
- **Functional requirements** (what the system/model should _do_)
- **Non-functional requirements** (how well it should _perform_, maintain, and scale)

## **1. Systemic Risk Modeling Using Network Analysis of Financial Markets**

### **Concept**

Study the _propagation of systemic risk_ through interconnected financial institutions using graph theory and stochastic modeling. The goal is to quantify contagion risk and identify critical nodes (institutions or assets) in the financial network.

### **Public Datasets**

- **Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED)** — interbank rates, macroeconomic indicators
- **Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)** — GDP, interest rates, etc.
- **Yahoo Finance / Quandl / Kaggle (financial market data)** — equities, bonds, indices, CDS spreads
- **ECB’s Statistical Data Warehouse** — for European data

### **Functional Requirements**

- Construct dynamic financial networks from time-series data (e.g., correlation or partial correlation networks of asset returns).
- Compute network metrics: centrality, clustering coefficient, eigenvector centrality, etc.
- Develop a risk propagation model (e.g., DebtRank, Eisenberg-Noe model).
- Simulate shocks to nodes and measure systemic impact over time.
- Visualize the network and contagion dynamics interactively.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Scalability:** Efficiently handle large-scale datasets (e.g., thousands of assets).
- **Reproducibility:** Use containerization (Docker) and version-controlled code (Git).
- **Performance:** Simulation and network metric computation under 5 minutes for large data.
- **Interpretability:** Results must be explainable — highlight systemically important nodes.

## **2. Option Pricing via Deep Learning and Stochastic Differential Equations**

### **Concept**

Compare classical option pricing models (e.g., Black–Scholes, Heston) with **deep neural networks trained on simulated or real option data** to estimate implied volatility surfaces and price derivatives.

### **Public Datasets**

- **CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange)** — option prices, implied volatilities
- **Yahoo Finance** — underlying asset prices (e.g., SPX, AAPL)
- **Quandl** — historical volatility and interest rate data

### **Functional Requirements**

- Implement benchmark stochastic models: Black-Scholes, Heston, Bates, etc.
- Train deep neural networks to approximate the pricing function ( f(S, K, T, \sigma, r) ).
- Compare performance in terms of pricing accuracy, calibration speed, and generalization.
- Generate implied volatility surfaces and analyze stability across market regimes.
- Backtest using historical option data.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Accuracy:** MAPE or RMSE of predicted prices < 5% vs. market prices.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Model calibration in under 1 minute for standard option sets.
- **Reproducibility:** Consistent results using random seeds and documented hyperparameters.
- **Robustness:** Handle missing data and market anomalies gracefully.

## **3. Portfolio Optimization with Regime-Switching and Reinforcement Learning**

### **Concept**

Develop a **dynamic portfolio allocation system** that adapts to market regimes using a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** or **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. The aim is to maximize risk-adjusted returns under realistic transaction and liquidity constraints.

### **Public Datasets**

- **Yahoo Finance / Alpha Vantage APIs** — daily stock prices, ETFs, indices
- **FRED** — macroeconomic indicators for regime classification
- **Kaggle “Stock Market Data”** or **Quandl WIKI dataset** — alternative sources

### **Functional Requirements**

- Identify market regimes using unsupervised learning (HMM, k-means on volatility metrics).
- Build a portfolio optimization engine (Markowitz, CVaR, RL-based).
- Incorporate constraints: transaction costs, short-selling limits, leverage.
- Compare RL policies vs. static optimization strategies.
- Visualize performance metrics: Sharpe ratio, drawdown, volatility, turnover.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Stability:** Avoid overfitting by enforcing rolling-window validation.
- **Scalability:** Support up to 500 assets without significant lag.
- **Transparency:** Generate interpretable policy decisions and risk explanations.
- **Extensibility:** Modular code allowing easy substitution of models (e.g., PPO, DDPG).
